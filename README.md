Problem of Statement:


Developing countries like Ethiopian agricultural sector faces significant challenges in delivering quality products from farms to consumers. Current delivery systems often suffer from inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and inadequate infrastructure, resulting in post-harvest losses, reduced product quality, and limited market access for farmers.
This situation is exacerbated by fragmentation in supply chains, insufficient integration of technology, and poor communication between stakeholders, including farmers, transporters, and consumers. As a result, consumers receive inconsistent quality and limited information about the origin of their food, while farmers struggle to achieve fair prices and maintain sustainable practices.
To address these challenges, we come up with a tailored agriculture quality products delivery system (Agrictech-Fayda) that enhances efficiency, ensures product quality, and fosters transparency throughout the supply chain. This system should leverage technology, promote collaboration among stakeholders, and incorporate sustainable practices to meet the growing demand for high-quality agricultural products in a way that benefits all participants in the ecosystem.

Planned Solution:

We will develop an integrated website and mobile app that connects Farmers, Clusters, Transporters, and Consumers (Supermarkets) while utilizing data analytics for demand forecasting.

Expected Outcome:

As we planned to advance the agriculture industry with a high-tech end solution by integrating farmers with FAYDA ID, we bring; 

Improved Delivery System

Improved Product Quality

Higher Farmers Income

Minimize Wastage/Increase Transparency
